Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective
lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, 
choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

SOLUTION: 
select city, length(city) 
from (select * from station order by length(city) asc, city asc)
where rownum <= 1;


select city, length(city) 
from (select * from station order by length(city) desc, city asc)
where rownum <= 1;

Lesson learnt:
where rownum <= 1 to be noticed

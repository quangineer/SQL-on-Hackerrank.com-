select city (excluding duplicates) in which first and last letter of city is vowels

>>>>>>>>> ORACLE SQL:
SELECT city
FROM station
WHERE (
   LOWER(city) LIKE 'a%' 
   OR LOWER(city) LIKE 'e%' 
   OR LOWER(city) LIKE 'i%' 
   OR LOWER(city) LIKE 'o%' 
   OR LOWER(city) LIKE 'u%'
)
AND (
   LOWER(city) LIKE '%a' 
   OR LOWER(city) like '%e' 
   OR LOWER(city) LIKE '%i' 
   OR LOWER(city) LIKE '%o' 
   OR LOWER(city) LIKE '%u'
);

LOWER(city): lower case of city

>>>>>>>>> MYSQL:
select distinct city from station 
where left(city,1) in ('a','e','i','o','u') 
and right(city, 1) in ('a','e','i','o','u')

left(city,1): extract from left 1 letter
right(city,1): extract from right 1 letter


MYSQL consider LOWER and UPPER case as one
ORACLE consider LOWER and UPPER case separately , thus need to have LOWER() function

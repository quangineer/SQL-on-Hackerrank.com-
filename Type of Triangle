# Write a SQL query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths to output one of the following statements:
# Equilateral ; Isosceles ; Scalene ; Not A Triangle
# The TRIANGLES table as follows:
Column    Type
  A      Integer
  B      Integer
  C      Integer
# Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

SELECT CASE WHEN A + B > C AND B + C > A AND A + C > B
THEN CASE WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'EQUILATERAL'
WHEN A = B OR B = C OR C = A THEN 'ISOSCELES'
WHEN A != B OR B != C OR A != C THEN 'SCALENE'
END ELSE 'NOT A TRIANGLE' END 
FROM TRIANGLES;
